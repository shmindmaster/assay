# 4. Replay by default, live calls opt-in

**Status:** accepted
**Surface:** S2

## 4.1 Decision

The default provider is `src/providers/replay.mjs`, which serves recorded
request and response pairs from `fixtures/provider/`. No documented command
requires an API key, an account, or a network call. Live provider calls are
opt-in behind `ASSAY_LIVE=1` and are exercised only by `npm run verify:live`,
which is not part of `npm run demo` or `npm test`.

## 4.2 The constraint that forced it

Three constraints, all pointing the same way.

**Adoption.** A reviewer decides whether to read this in the first minute. A
prompt for a key spends that minute and usually ends the evaluation.

**Reproducibility.** The demos assert on exact output — a missing record, a
refusal, a `+31.8%` variance. A live model makes each run different, and a demo
that differs per run cannot be audited, which contradicts the repository's entire
argument.

**What is being demonstrated.** The claim is about the control layer, not about
model quality. The hero case needs the model to produce a specific wrong answer —
`COMPLETE` for PO-AER-5519 — so the broker can be seen catching it. Sampling for
that is unreliable and expensive; recording it is neither.

## 4.3 Alternatives rejected

**Live calls by default.** Rejected on all three constraints above.

**A local model.** Rejected: it trades a key for a multi-gigabyte download and a
GPU assumption, which is worse on adoption, and it does not fix reproducibility.

**A hand-written mock returning canned objects.** Rejected because it would not
exercise the adapters. Recorded fixtures are real provider payloads, so the
strict tool-use and structured-output paths are genuinely traversed rather than
stubbed past. The distinction is the difference between testing the thing and
testing around it.

**Dropping the live path entirely.** Rejected. Without it the adapters are
unfalsifiable — the fixtures would only ever prove they agree with themselves.
`npm run verify:live` is how a change to an adapter gets checked against the real
API, deliberately and by choice, rather than on every run.

## 4.4 Consequences accepted

Fixtures go stale. A provider changing its response shape will not break
anything until someone runs the live path, so `npm run verify:live` is the only
thing standing between a recorded fixture and a fiction. This is the real cost of
the decision and it is not fully mitigated.

A missing fixture must fail loudly, naming the key and how to record it. A silent
fallthrough to a live call would reintroduce every constraint above at the worst
possible moment.

The replay key is a hash of decision id, prompt hash and provider name, so any
change to prompt assembly invalidates the fixtures. That coupling is intentional
— a fixture that survives a prompt change is no longer recording the same
question — but it makes prompt edits more expensive than they look.
